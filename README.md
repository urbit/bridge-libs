# Bridge Libraries

Libraries for doing heavy lifting in an Azimuth/Ethereum context. In use by Bridge, but also WIP in many ways.

Todo:
- Get rid of folktale dependency, especially for in/output.
- Update dependencies to latest versions.
- Review structure of files, functions etc.
- Add tests.
- Convert to TypeScript?
